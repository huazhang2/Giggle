Q: How do I make the option/alt key act like Meta or send escape codes?

A: Go to Preferences->Profiles tab. Select your profile on the left,
and then open the Keyboard tab. At the bottom is a set of buttons
that lets you select the behavior of the Option key. For most users, Esc+ will be the best choice.
